{% include fold.html %}

The property is an elegant, luxurious, inter-generational family house. According to the new
owner's needs, it could be developed into
an exclusive guest house, an artist's retreat, or a high-end restaurant.

Four separate apartments plus a finished attic ensures the comfort of its future residents.
There is also a large living room with fireplace, painted wood ceiling dining room for 20 people with
cozy wood burning masonry stove, and a
stunning river view from the 120 m2 rooftop terrace.
In a separate building an indoor swimming pool, sauna and gym—as well as the outdoor tennis
court provide opportunities for physical training.
The buildings are discreetly away from the main road, at the upper end of the sizeable plot, only 100
meters from the Danube River, but on top of a completely flood-proof hill.

The House was designed by Moric Pogany, an outstanding architect of the Hungarian Art Nouveau
architecture for dr. Karoly Lamotte, former deputy mayor of Budapest, the Pest Hungarian Trade
Bank's Chief Executive Officer, Member of the Upper House of the Hungarian Parliament, and for
his wife, Countess Eszter Forgacs. The villa was built as a summer house, and it was completed in
1939. During the war, the Lamotte's house on Buda's Castle Hill was completely ruined,
consequently the family moved to the village of Leanyfalu, where they lived until the end of their
lives. The building later became the creative retreat of the Mafilm movie studio. After the fall of
communism, András László acquired the property and later it was auctioned. Beginning of the
1990s, András László significant renovations and alterations accomplished on the property, when
the swimming pool was also built next to the main building. After the death of Andras Laszlo, the
house stood empty for nearly 20 years, but at the beginning of this millennium, temporary
construction for preservation was carried out. In 2013-14 the new owners of the property conducted
a more thorough professional renovation (roof, facade, floor terrace, engineering, finishing of the
attic), so the villa may be offered for sale in the best state ever.

The property can be accessed from the main road through a remote control gate. The two
separately registered lots are nearly 0.55 hectare. Landscaped with ancient trees, the park-like
garden includes a dual-purpose automatic watering system: rainwater cistern or well water.
Two huge sycamore trees and many giant pine trees guard the peace of the house. The
regulation-sized, fenced, programmed watering, illuminated, clay tennis court is dwarfed by
the huge garden.

We can approach the building complex, containing the main building and
annex, (total area 775 sq meter) situated on the uppermost part of the lot on a natural stone
path.

The four-story main building contains a floor area of 693 sqm. On top of the poured concrete
foundation the brick perimeter walls are 38 cm thick. A 5-6 cm thick exterior graphite thermal insulation fully
preserves the entire building’s style. In the spring of 2014, the roof of the building has been
completely renovated. Inside the roof a 30 cm thick mineral wool insulation with 5 cm air gap
were installed.

The source of heating and domestic hot water is a Buderus-brand thermal
engineering systems with solar collectors, and a convertible gas boiler. Also, traditional
heating assures the comfort of the residents: the living room has an open fireplace in green
marble, the dining room a tile stove, and the attic apartment an iron stove.

**Ground floor.** Entrance hall with half bath opens to the wood-inlaid-floor receiving room.
From here we can go to the living room, directly to the upper levels, or through a hidden door
to what used to be "the servant's entrance", and finally, through the kitchen, to the service
entrance of the building. The living room opens to the dining room/wine bar, with a huge dining
table accommodating up to 20 people simultaneously. The dining room ceiling deserves special
attention: the protected wood paneled, painted and carved ceiling is original as well as the stained
glass windows below.

**Second floor.** Four completely separate apartments open from an exclusive, dark mahogany wood-
paneled central hall.
The **Lamotte suite** opens into a library-office, with also dark mahogany walls and shelves that are
extremely tasteful.
From here, over the top of the pool building, a 120 m2 panoramic terrace opens. The other room of
the suite is a bedroom, where mahogany wainstcoting lower panels tastefully match the wallpaper
above. A walk-in closet and full bath completes the master bedroom. Built-in mahogany furniture
and wall paneling make the apartment unique.

stone statuettes.

The whole **attic area** is a completely separate apartment, bright, youthful, loft-style space.

room and a home office corner. Also two bedrooms and two walk-in closets open from here.
One bedroom has a large bathroom, the other a broom closet. In case of different functional
demand the whole attic space is easily convertible to an artist's studio, due to its brightness
and ample space.

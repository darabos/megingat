For sale is a rare 57 ha (141 acre) contiguous  property, part of it is wooded (50 ha)  and 7 ha is cleared
and zoned for a leisure park and holiday village. Indeed, a fresh building permit has recently been 
obtained for the complex!

This property is in the Balaton highland, near the famous wine country of Badacsony, and close to the 
famous thermal baths of the area. The property is not far from the Austrian border, as well from the 
capital, Budapest. It is served by both good public transportation and a nearby highway.

The building area is directly adjacent to a 7 ha well stocked open­access municipal lake, and to the 50
ha private forest.

Here you can take steps to immediately begin development in a truly peaceful setting.
Feeding the lake, there is a creek that flows through adjacent conservation areas and maintains the 
freshness of the forest.

The mature forest is about 70­year­old, it is a big game hunting area. It is possible to hunt in our own
forest estate!
Approx. 12,000 m3 of timber stock mostly red oak, to a lesser extent oak and pine. 
A special feature is that unlike most national forests, its usage is solely determined by the owner. It is 
quite uniquely in Hungary.

Electricity and piped gas line run at the boundary, running water and sewage connection are available
about 1000 meter away, but sewage tanks and drilled wells (with excellent quality water) are also 
possible.
The local government fully supports the development of the property. It would prefer tourism, health 
tourism, fishing, hunting, sports and equestrian sport.
(.. Of course, this is only a possibility. Whether private, or dual purpose development ­­ it's the owner's 
choice.) The plan is realistic because the location of the property is excellent: renowned wine regions, 
spas, places to visit, Balaton, Győr, Austria and Budapest also easily accessible. 
The current support competition will help to make the improvements.

A rare opportunity, where one can build a holiday village, it's possible to hunt, and the wood production
of an unrestricted standing forest can pay most of the price of the prestige property.

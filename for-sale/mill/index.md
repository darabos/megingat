## Asking price: 500000 €

Exciting, unique, 5.8 ha (approximately 15 acres) property located between two
branches of the permanent
Sed patak (Shaid stream). The property is only 30 km from the famous tourist
and health center of
Balatonfured—consequently from the "Hungarian sea" of Lake Balaton. Also
close by is the world famous Herend Porcelain Works.

The unique attraction of the large property is a converted water mill, originally
built in 1854, which was turned residential
in 2009. The thorough renovation kept the landmark features of the old
building, while providing luxury accommodations between
the traditional thick walls.

In the 300m2 (almost 3000 sqft) two-tory building there are two apartments: a
four-room and a two-room for guests.
The finishing of the attic is in a starting phase.

The beautiful and healthy home is not only environmentally friendly, low
maintenance but also independent of service providers—in other words, it's
free living!
Free electricity is provided by the water-mill generator and the solar panels on
the roof.
Clean drinking water comes from a deep well, fire wood for heating is from the
0.8 ha private forest. Besides central heating, there is a wood burning tile
stove and an open fireplace as well.

{% include fold.html %}

**A family estate on 16 hectare (40 acre) of land is for sale from € 650,000 in a unique natural environment in the Bakony-alja region.**

The roughly square-shaped plot of land holds six lakes with abundant fish. The lakes have a total area of 10 hectares (25 acres) are 3-4 meter deep. A fast flowing stream from the Bakony runs by the plot and brings serenity with it.

**The estate can now be bought as a whole or split into its natural units.**

The land and the lakes are bordered by a strip of woods. Racka sheep are put to pasture on 6 hectares (15 acres) next to the lakes. Songbirds live on the trees of the park and in birdhouses. Water fowl inhabit the reed beds. Deer often visit from the surrounding areas.

The 300 square meter (3200 square foot) family home (built in 2000) is nestled in between the lakes such that the light playing on the water surface is visible from the windows looking in each direction.

This picturesque environment is just the right distance from civilisation to make its comforts accessible without exposing its owners to its annoyances.

Owners will not need a lawnmower. The two dozen Hungarian Racka sheep take care of it in the summer. They spend their winters in the barn living off of the fodder collected from the hayfield. Lambs can be sold off to avoid overcrowding the pasture.

An orchard and kitchen garden offer an abundance of tasty pleasures to their caretakers. The lakes provide fresh catch for a variety of dishes.

The manor house stands on a reinforced concrete foundation. The 60 cm (2 foot) thick external walls have two layers, stone on the outside and masonry on the inside. Oaken doors and windows and a robust thatched wooden roof give the building a look that is in complete harmony with its surroundings.

Running the building is economical. A 70 meter (200 foot) deep well provides certified pure drinking water. Two gas boilers heat it up. Sewage goes into cesspit built to regulations. Gas is available for heating as well but the estate provides enough wood for fueling the fireplace or the central heating unit.

The building is cross shaped. The basement holds the room for the central heating (with two burners), the cellar, a summer kitchen and the boat storage room. The ground floor holds the open kitchen, the 50 square meter (500 square foot) lounge, 3 bedrooms, a study, a guest room, staff room, 3 bathrooms, winter garden, hall, heated double garage and vast terraces. A separate one bedroom apartment with its own front door is also a part of the building.
**The main building plus the largest lake plus a smaller lake plus 330 m of riverside land are on sale for € 650,000.** The buyer also gets right of first refusal to the remaining (neighboring) land at an especially low price set in the contract for one year after the purchase.

You can walk, run, ride a bike or a horse, row a boat, sail, surf, fish, garden and tend to animals to your heart’s content right on the estate. In every season it provides peace but also excitement to residents of all ages but would provide the most for raising children. Live as one with nature.

Az ingatlant adottságai alkalmassá teszik akár üzleti célú felhasználásra is. A természet megóvása mellett még további lakóházak is építhetők a tavak partjára. Változatos helyszíne filmforgatásra is alkalmassá teszi, sőt, ihletet is nyújtó, de pl. közösségépítő-, testi-lelki rehabilitációs-, speciális idős- vagy gyermekotthon munkáját is jelentősen támogató tényező, hogy e varázslatos birtokon a természet részeként élhetünk.

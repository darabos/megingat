The 300 square meter (3200 square foot) family home (built in 2000) is nestled in between the lakes such that the light playing on the water surface is visible from the windows looking in each direction.

This picturesque environment is just the right distance from civilisation to make its comforts accessible without exposing its owners to its annoyances.

Owners will not need a lawnmower. The two dozen Hungarian Racka sheep take care of it in the summer. They spend their winters in the barn living off of the fodder collected from the hayfield. Lambs can be sold off to avoid overcrowding the pasture.

Az ingatlant adottságai alkalmassá teszik akár üzleti célú felhasználásra is. A természet megóvása mellett még további lakóházak is építhetők a tavak partjára. Változatos helyszíne filmforgatásra is alkalmassá teszi, sőt, ihletet is nyújtó, de pl. közösségépítő-, testi-lelki rehabilitációs-, speciális idős- vagy gyermekotthon munkáját is jelentősen támogató tényező, hogy e varázslatos birtokon a természet részeként élhetünk.

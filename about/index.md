## I am Ildikó Kovács.

I continued my studies majoring in Communications. My present
interest is psychology. In 2005 I worked for a leading real estate company, later becoming
self-employed. Over the years, in cooperation with Hungarian and foreign partners,
I have built relationships and experiences that help my work to this day.
My motto, "Choose a profession you love and you never have to work!" (Confucius)

## I am Zsóka Darabosné.

My pedagogy, health and coaching qualifications
helped me to help others over the years. Working as a real estate agent, so far
this work is the most exciting activity to help others! :)

Two people, two-way, two life... and thanks to a magical property for sale, today
we are colleagues and friends ...
The inspiration for starting the **Megingat Real Estate** agency was our common interests and life
experiences, and the shared desire to help our clients to realize their secret dreams.

If you have been told that what you are **looking for** does not exist, please do not give up!
This is a promise: we will find it for you! :)

If you have a special property **for sale** and you want to use our services, please do not
hesitate to contact us! Commission is due only after a successful sale and based on mutual
agreement in the contract. You will be provided with precise and detailed information during a
personal meeting.

Thank you for your trust and we look forward to your call!

Ildikó & Zsóka
